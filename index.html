       <h1 class="accordion"> Mobile Application Development</h1>
       <div class="panel">
       <p> Mobile application development creates software for digital assistants and smartphones. Users can access the
         software on their device through a mobile web browser or download it from a mobile app store. The programming languages used for
          such software include HTML5, C#, Java, and Swift.
        
        Today, mobile devices and applications provide the most convenient way for companies to connect to the internet. To stay responsive,
         businesses need to develop mobile applications that their employees, partners, and customers demand.

       <h1 class="accordion"> IT Consulting</h1>
       <div class=" panel">
       <p> IT consulting services help clients evaluate different technology strategies and align them with your business.
         These services provide strategic, operational, and architectural planning to support customers’ IT initiatives. Strategic 
         planning involves advisory services that allow clients to gauge their IT needs before formulating implementation plans.
        
        Moreover, architectural planning involves advisory services, combining knowledge and strategic plans of emerging technologies
         to develop the system’s local design and support infrastructure. Operational assessment features services assessing the functioning
         efficiency and the capacity of the client’s IT setting.

       <h1 class="accordion"> Software Prototyping</h1>
       <div class="panel">
       <p> The process of software prototyping creates incomplete versions of an application for its progressive improvement.
         It’s somewhat similar to the prototyping generally performed in mechanical and manufacturing fields. Typically, a software
          prototype only executes a few of the required features. IT can also be significantly different from the final product. 
        
        The benefit of prototyping is that developers obtain regular user feedback early in the project. Both users and developers 
        can easily determine how well the prototype fits the software specifications used to build a prototype. Moreover, project managers 
        can ensure that their initial milestones and deadlines are realistic.
